tec1 experiments in Electrohydrodynamics

Back in 1979 this was a year 11 science project I submitted at Ashfield Boys High. A simple machine to push ionized steam thru a reverse polarity grid, this causes a current to flow, between the collector plate and ground, that is past the reverse polarity grid. In other words turn steam into a direct current with no moving parts. The ions have to do work to overcome the same polarity; they are push thru by the steam pressure.

The concept is similar to what I saw Julius Sumner Miller do with dripping water, and causing this to flash a fluorescent  tube. Turn physical motion of charged water into a current.
