tec1 experiments in Electrohydrodynamics

Back in 1979 this was a year 11 science project I submitted at Ashfield Boys High. a simple machine to pass ionized steam thru a reverse polarity grid, this cause a current to flow, between the collector plate and ground, that is past the reverse polarity grid. In other words turn steam into a direct current with no moving parts.

The concept is similar to what I saw Julius Sumner Miller do with dripping water, and causing this to flash a  fluorescent  tube. Turn physical motion of charged water into a current.
